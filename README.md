The Odin Project Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project was built with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It is a rough product, but will revist when learn more about design and try to make it prettier. Game is fully
functional.

With this project I learned about linking different pages together, how to access html elements with JS, and linking JS functionality with DOM elements.
